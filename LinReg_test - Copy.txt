				Live model building Test
				=========================

1. Treat it as interview coding test.
2. Questions will not be entertained.
3. Based on your understanding you have to build model as there is no one standard way.
4. We will post the code (solution) by EOD tomorrow in the same link.
==================================================================================================================

1. Read the file from the dive.(file name - Test_Sales_LinReg.csv)

2. Build linear regression model the way you have learned in the classes.

A. Do all necessary analysis using graphs.
B. If any of the features doesn't have relationship then remove and build the model.

3. This is just for your practice purpose and nothing related to evaluation or placement activities.

Important Note - Upload your jupyter notebook in your github and share the github link in the support.datatrained.org chatbox (Not in Zoom chat)
